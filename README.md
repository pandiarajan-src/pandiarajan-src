## Hi, Welcome, its me Pandiarajan you can call me Pandi 👋
You might recognize me as GitHub’s pandiarajan-src.

## About Me
🔭 I’m currently immersed in the world of software development, where we engage in a lot of discussions and lot of actual coding.

🤔 With extensive experience in designing, developing, and delivering software platforms/products, I’ve honed my skills in managing customer relations.

🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into the realms of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a Tamil poet once wisely said, “கற்றதுகைம் மண்ணளவு கல்லா துலகளவு” (Learning is as vast as the ocean).

⚡ I’m eager to learn and evolve, and I welcome your guidance to help me become the best version of myself.

👯 I’m actively seeking collaboration on open-source projects that pique my interest. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to contribute and assist others.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to adjust or personalize this as needed. Best of luck for your journey! 😊
